Functionality: 4/5, sinh and cosh were never actually in the built functions, and X(a,b) and Y(a,b) were not included. I feel that this was the assignment not being entirely clear though, and what you did was reasonable enough and the art looked cool.
Documentation: 5/5, dandy, you saved the results and your code had the nessecary doctests.
Style: 5/5

Overall, nice job and really cool extra credit stuff. Since you went above and beyond, despite a few issues with the random functions that were generated, you still will get a full score. But please do look at the comments and see what the mistakes in generate_random_func() were. Cool visuals!
